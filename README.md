### Gemini (Game Engine Mini)

## History
I needed a small, fast game engine but I wanted it to be used in conjunction with Compose Multiplatrform,
so that I can leverage all of the great features already available. I looked at the many other game engines
available, both open source and closed, but none fit my needs. So Geminit was born.
